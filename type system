- every type has given set of possible conversion
- every function is defined for some set of types
- code is evaluated before "execution" - given all possible types, is it possible to use all operations with some type?
- every returned value from function may have limited type
- possible "inheritance" between types for simpler definition

Predefined types:
- int
- float
- string
- enum (special case bool => true, false)
- function
- capsule (defined for operator [], array, hash)
